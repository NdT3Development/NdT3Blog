title: Development And Support For My Discord Bot Has Been Stopped
---
On 15 October 2017, I created a GitHub repository called `DiscordBot`. As the name suggests, it's a bot for the popular chat application, Discord. It was based on the [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide/) bot and I've slowly been adding my own features over time. And as shown by the commit history, I initially worked on it a lot, but due to lack of motivation and my busy schedule, development slowed down until it completely stopped over a year ago.

I've still been providing support for anyone wanting to host their own instance of the bot, but that will change today. Here's why:

- **It started as a way for me to learn programming.** I had already learnt basic website development and wanted to start with programming. The bot provided me with an opportunity to learn.

- **Support:** I've had many people contact me, either through email or Discord, asking for help with the bot. And while I loved having people use something I made, most of the people wanting support didn't read the instructions or wanted to change something but were too lazy to look at how the bot works. I even once had someone who wanted me to change the whole design of the dashboard, and got annoyed when I didn't reply quickly (time zones are a thing, don't expect me to reply at 3AM).

- **Old code:** As previously mentioned, I started this project in 2017. Since then, many things have changed. I've tested the bot in Node.js v8, but haven't been able to successfully set it up with Node.js v12. Due to my busy schedule, I don't have the time to rewrite the bot to ensure it works properly on newer versions of Node.js or Discord.js.

- **Lack of motivation:** As not many people use my bot (I estimate that there are probably a maximum of 40 instances of the bot running, although it's probably a lot less than that), and I don't make any money from developing it, I don't have any motivation to continue working on it.

- **Credit:** Many of the people have removed all credit to me being the developer. Please don't do this. It's not your own work, and even I have credited the people that helped me.

The GitHub repository will be archived, and all further support requests will be denied.

Apologies to those who use the bot, but it's time for me to move on. There are many other great options for bots, many under active development and with enough funding and support that makes it worth keeping it going.
